Okay, I understand. Unfortunately, I cannot directly create a .doc file for you. My current capabilities allow me to process and present text, but not directly generate document formats.

However, I can provide you with the text content from the OCR I did on the images, formatted in a way that you can easily copy and paste into a word processing program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, and then save as a .doc or .docx file.

Here's the text, formatted for easy copying:
